❌ when there is no need to override
    1. instance of a class is unique by nature (User)
    2. identity matters more than contents (db connection)
    3. superclass overrides equals already && it makes sense for the class
    4. private & package private classes && equals will never be used

✅ need to override equals()
    1. When designing a value class
        - exception: if only one object exists per value (enums, caching)

📝 Java Review
    - use 🟪 private static 🟪 when the inner class doesn't need to access 
    outer class instance
    - use 🟪 private non-static 🟪 when it needs access to outer class
