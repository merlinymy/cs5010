Hashing, Hashcode, HashSet, HashTable

- hash collision:
    - probing, move to the next location 
    - chaining, linkedList 

🔨 A HashSet
    1. when call add, call hashfunction, check location, if null, create new linkedlist

HashCode:
    override hashCode() whenever overriding equals()

📏 
    1. always return the same value for a given object
    2. Obj A equals.(Obj B), hashCode() must return the same values for them.
    ✅ 3. Quick to compute
        4. Different strings have diff hash values
